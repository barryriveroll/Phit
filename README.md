## About

Phit is a full-stack biometrics tracking application. Designed with ease-of-use, user customization, and clear data visualization at the forefront. Easily save nutrition and exercise data and monitor progress on a single page.

## Technologies

Phit was built using full MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with the front-end framework from Material UI and charts via Chart.js.

## API Note

We use Nutritionix API for our food data, but are currently on the free tier which has a fairly strict daily limit on API calls. If you experience issues with trying to add food data, this is likely the issue. Sorry for any inconvenience!
